This program may need a different class of code to connect with the "Quanser Interactive Software".

Created this program with my group partner, Tyler Vecchio (Mechanical Engineering Student).
My additional two group members, Adeel Ahmad (Computer Engineering Student) and Sehaj Ajimal (Software Engineering Student), have created the hardware aspect of the project - a unique, functional dispensing device.

This code will help many students in first year engineering at McMaster University (unless they change the project).
